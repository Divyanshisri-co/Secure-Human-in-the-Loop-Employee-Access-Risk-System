# Secure-Human-in-the-Loop-Employee-Access-Risk-System
This project implements a Secure Employee Access Risk System that combines Machine Learning with a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach to control employee access to sensitive resources. The system automatically approves low-risk requests while escalating medium and high-risk requests for human review, ensuring both efficiency and security.
